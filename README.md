Building a tool that assesses the strength of a password based on criteria such as length, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Provide feedback to users on the password's strength.

### SKILLS LEARNED
* I mastered the use of Regular expereince in python
* I mastered hownto use logic fuction( fuction like: if, else, elif)
* learnt how to make Python code work like an application with the simple call of a function
* learnt how to turn Python code into a Windows and Android application.

### STEPS/PROCESS
* I import "regex" fuction.
* i define Scoring Logic where i assign points as score based on the presence of all elemenet that will help user make a strong password. Example:
  * Length greater then 12 characters: +2 points
  * Contains uppercase: +1
  * Contains lowercase: +1
  * Contains numbers: +1
  * Contains special characters: +1
  * Evaluate the Password Use regular expressions (regex) to detect these criteria.
* I provide Feedback Based on the score point.
* I create a fuction to make the aplication usable.
